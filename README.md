# Framework Approach
I used a combination of selenium + capybara & siteprism which is what I am used to.

# To run
To run this, just do a bundle and then run "cucumber" which will run against chrome.
If you use "browser=firefox cucumber" it will run in firefox, although currently it opens firefox but does not run!
